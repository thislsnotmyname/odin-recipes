# odin-recipes
This project's purpose is to practice and showcase basic HTML practices such as boilerplate code, file hierarchy, and basic site layout, including information hierarchy.
While rudimentary at the time of writing, this project will later serve to showcase the progress I will make.
This project was created as an exercise for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).
